Learning to code can be intimidating. 

There is so much you could learn: so many different buzzwords, languages, frameworks, libraries... so many topics, with layers and layers to each one. 

Where do you start? How deep do you go into each subject? What do you __need__ to know? What can you ignore?

We can't learn it all. The end goal is to either start a new career, and become more technically skilled in your current career. So time is of the essence.

Most introductory coding courses force you to choose a certain path. They teach a particular programming language, a particular set of concepts. 

That particular path might be the right choice for you. Or it might not be. 

The bigger problem is that most courses move too fast. They introduce concepts without context. They tell you how to do things, without ensuring you understand __why__ you would want to do that. (And __why__ bit is the important bit.)

I built Thinking in Code to fix all these problems. 

I wanted to provide the best possible foundation for beginners coders. I wanted to give you a sense of understanding, that you "get it". I want you to feel confident coding.

So I took some time and I thought about what a beginner coder needs to know. And I realized there are universal principles to code, that hold true across all programming languages/frameworks/libraries. 

If you master those universal concepts, and really understand how and why to use them, everything else will come easier.

More importantly: you'll understand what you can achieve, what you can __build__ with code. And that's the fun part.

**Thinking in Code is the course I wish I had, when I started programming.**

In 13 short modules, you'll go from reading code in multiple programming languages to writing code in multiple languages. And it won't ever be overwhleming. 

By slowly introducing you to essential concepts, and letting you see them action, you'll build fluency, step by step. 

By the end of this course, you'll feel confident working with code. If not, I'll give you a full refund. No questions asked, no time limit.

Want to learn more? Here's a quick example of the code we'll start off with:

```
print('Hello <NAME>! Congratulations! You executed your first code.')
```

And here's the code we'll end with:

```
const friends = [{ name: 'Scott' }, { name: 'Bob' }, { name: 'Alice' }];

function capitalizeName(user) {
  user[name] = user[name].toUpperCase();
};

friends.forEach(friend => capitalizeName(friend));
```

By the end of this course, each line of the above will make perfect sense. (In fact, you'll be able to spot a few ways to make it better!)

Here's the full list of modules:

1. Why thinking in code matters
2. How to reach fluency
3. How to learn what you don't know
4. Setting up for the course 
5. Variables & simple math
6. Functions
7. Control flow
8. Booleans & comparisons
9. Lists & loops 
10. Dictionaries
11. Writing readable code
12. Libraries
13. Learning to build 

Curious who I am? My name is Scott, and I've been working as a software developer for five years now. I've worked for big companies and small startups. I've taught introductory courses in the past, written dozens of programming articles, and even wrote a book. 

Here's what people say about my teaching:

> 5 out of 5 across the board. The students describe Scott as patient and helpful and always made them feel as though their questions were important. They enjoyed his style of delivery and ability to cover a lot of information without making it feel overwhelming. 

> Scott is an awesome teacher, great at showing examples and clear with them as well.
One of the better teachers all together I have learned from... making this course a lot easier.
