description: Peter Thiel on controlling our future

In the autumn of 1962, President John F. Kennedy gave a speech at a university stadium in Texas. In a short thirty minute speech, he commited to landing a man on the moon within the decade.

This was not the first time Kennedy had spoken about this idea. In May of the previous year, he had told Congress that the US "should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth." But the reception was mixed: 58 percent of Americans opposed the idea.

But Kennedy pressed on. And on a sunny day in Texas, to a crowd of 40,000, he restated his conviction that American should pursue this goal at all costs, and it would be a betrayel of national character to _not_ do so.

Take a look at the language he used:

> William Bradford, speaking in 1630 of the founding of the Plymouth Bay Colony, said that all great and honorable actions are accompanied with great difficulties, and both must be enterprised and overcome with answerable courage.

> Those who came before us made certain that this country rode the first waves of the industrial revolutions, the first waves of modern invention, and the first wave of nuclear power, and this generation does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age of space. *We mean to be a part of it--we mean to lead it.*

> We choose to go to the moon. *We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard*, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.

Kennedy's dream was fulfilled in 1969, six years after his death. One newspaper editor who was present at the speech described it as speaking "to the way Americans viewed the future in those days. It is a great speech, one that encapsulates all of recorded history and seeks to set it in the history of our own time. Unlike todayâ€™s politicians, Kennedy spoke to our best impulses as a nation, not our worst."

### Potential futures

What is the future of American spaceflight?

Depending on your level of expertise, it's a tough question to answer. Watching rocket launches has become a cultural touchstone, and Elon Musk talks openly of landing a person on Mars. Without doing much research, the average person would probably be pretty optimistic.

What if we asked the same question to someone sitting in that stadium in 1962, prior to Kennedy's speech? They'd probably be less optimistic. At the time, the Soviets seemed to be winning the Space Race, and the Americans were playing catch up. Most observers would be somewhere between pessimistic to tentatively optimistic.

But look at Kennedy's speech ([full text here](https://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ricetalk.htm)). The language he uses is not pessimistic or tentative. It is completely optimistic. It is not vague. It is specific. We will reach _this_ goal, by the end of _this_ decade. Complete commitment.

We might say that Kennedy had _vision_, or _foresight_, or just plain _audacity_. But there's another term for this kind of thinking: _definite optimism._

### Uncertainty and certainty

Should you even try to predict the future?

From a philosophical point of view, it seems like a futile exercise. The world turns in surprising ways, spun about by chance events and black swans. The massive  volatility of the past year seems to point to a hard _no._

Now more than ever, our world is ruled by uncertainty.

But that doesn't mean we should give up trying to control our own futures.

At least, that's what Peter Thiel writes in his book on startups, _Zero to One._ Thiel co-founded PayPal and Palantir, and helped fund companies like Facebook, SpaceX, and LinkedIn. 

He sees predicting the future as not just a good thing, but an _essential_ exercise.

Why?

Well, he argues we can take two fundamental views of the future. The first is the _indefinite_ view. 

An indefinite future is unpredictable. We cannot foresee it, and it's pointless to try.

On the other hand, a _definite_ future is predictable. We may not be able to say who's going to win the Super Bowl next year, but we can discern the rough shape of what's going to happen within a certain lens: the fate of our particular industry, for example, or what our own lives will look like.

Thiel argues we should fervently believe in a definite future.

"If you treat the future as something definite," he writes in _Zero to One_, "it make sense to understand it in advance and to work to shape it."

"But if you expect an indefinite future ruled by randomness, you'll give up on trying to master it."

Believing in a future we can predict and shape gives us _power_. It motivates action, while an uncertain and unknowable future leads to passivity and despair.

A more casual way of saying this would be: "we don't know for sure, but we might as well try."

But Thiel makes a futher distinction. It's no use taking a definite view of the future if your prediction is full of doom and gloom.

This is what Thiel calls _definite pessimism_. The world is going to be worse than it is now, and here's how.

It goes hand-in-hand with an even _more_ poisonous attitude, _indefinite pessimism_. This is where we figure the world is going to get worse but we don't know how, exactly. Not very useful.

On the other side of the coin, we have both definite and indefinite optimism.

Indefinite optimism isn't much better than pessimism. The future will get better, but we don't know how. No actions to take here. Let's sit back and relax.

Definite optimism is the sweet spot. We can predict the future, at least in part. What's more, we can work to _create_ that future.

We have influence and power. More importantly, we have work to do. Let's get to it.

Thiel points to the US of the 1950s and 1960s as an example of definite optimism. Kennedy's speech is an embodiment of that attitude.

Again, look at the language the President uses:

> To be sure, we are behind, and will be behind for some time in manned flight. But we do not intend to stay behind, and in this decade, we shall make up and move ahead.

> However, I think we're going to do it, and I think that we must pay what needs to be paid. I don't think we ought to waste any money, but I think we ought to do the job. And this will be done in the decade of the sixties. 

We _are_ going to reach this goal. And we're going to do it in _this_ specific timeframe.

How can this kind of thinking _fail_ to shape the future? Not all such plans are successful, of course, but if one can align one's actions with this bold rhetoric... how can you doubt the power of that?

### Worse options

Since the 1960s, Thiel warns that the US has lapsed into indefinite optimism. The future will get better, certainly, but who knows how? No point making plans to get there, it'll just _arrive._

To complete the rubric, you have China with definite pessimism (e.g. Chinese nationals believing their country's wealth is temporary, and working hard to move their money abroad) and Europe with indefinite pessimism (reacting to bad events but doing nothing proactive).

The point Thiel makes is that it doesn't matter what worldview is _accurate._ Maybe we _can't_ shape the future.

But definite optimism gives us the best chance of doing so. The other options are all varying degrees of giving up.

What does definite optimism look like on a personal view? In short, setting goals and planning to accomplish them. Believing in your own ability to change your future, and looking forward to that future.

Not always easy to do, but an essential ingredient of a good life.
