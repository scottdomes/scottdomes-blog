description: Peter Thiel on controlling our future

Should you try to predict the future?

From a philosophical point of view, it seems like a futile exercise. The world turns in surprising ways, spun about by chance events and black swans. The massive  volatility of the past year seems to point to a hard _no._

Now more than ever, our world is ruled by uncertainty.

But that doesn't mean we should give up trying to control our own futures.

At least, that's what Peter Thiel writes in his book on startups, _Zero to One._ Thiel co-founded PayPal and Palantir, and helped fund companies like Facebook, SpaceX, and LinkedIn. 

He sees predicting the future as not just a good thing, but an _essential_ exercise.

Why?

Well, he argues we can take two fundamental views of the future. The first is the _indefinite_ view. 

An indefinite future is unpredictable. We cannot foresee it, and it's pointless to try.

On the other hand, a _definite_ future is predictable. We may not be able to say who's going to win the Super Bowl next year, but we can discern the rough shape of what's going to happen within a certain lens: the fate of our particular industry, for example, or what our own lives will look like.

Thiel argues we should fervently believe in a definite future.

"If you treat the future as something definite," he writes in _Zero to One_, "it make sense to understand it in advance and to work to shape it."

"But if you expect an indefinite future ruled by randomness, you'll give up on trying to master it."

Believing in a future we can predict and shape gives us _power_. It motivates action, while an uncertain and unknowable future leads to passivity and despair.

A more casual way of saying this would be: "we don't know for sure, but we might as well try."

But Thiel makes a futher distinction. It's no use taking a definite view of the future if your prediction is full of doom and gloom.

This is what Thiel calls _definite pessimism_. The world is going to be worse than it is now, and here's how.

It goes hand-in-hand with an even _more_ poisonous attitude, _indefinite pessimism_. This is where we figure the world is going to get worse but we don't know how, exactly. Not very useful.

On the other side of the coin, we have both definite and indefinite optimism.

Indefinite optimism isn't much better than pessimism. The future will get better, but we don't know how. No actions to take here. Let's sit back and relax.

Definite optimism is the sweet spot. We can predict the future, at least in part. What's more, we can work to _create_ that future.

We have influence and power. More importantly, we have work to do. Let's get to it.

Thiel points to the US of the 1950s and 1960s as an example of definite optimism. Definite optimism is Kennedy promising to land on the moon in X years. Definite optimism is deciding to build the Interstate Highway System, and opening up the first 20,000 miles of freeway less than a decade later.

Since then, however, he warns that the US has lapsed into indefinite optimism. The future will get better, certainly, but who knows how? No point making plans to get there, it'll just _arrive._

To complete the rubric, you have China with definite pessimism (e.g. Chinese nationals believing their country's wealth is temporary, and working hard to move their money abroad) and Europe with indefinite pessimism (reacting to bad events but doing nothing proactive).

The point Thiel makes is that it doesn't matter what worldview is _accurate._ Maybe we _can't_ shape the future.

But definite optimism gives us the best chance of doing so. The other options are all varying degrees of giving up.

What does definite optimism look like on a personal view? In short, setting goals and planning to accomplish them. Believing in your own ability to change your future, and looking forward to that future.

Not always easy to do, but an essential ingredient of a good life.
