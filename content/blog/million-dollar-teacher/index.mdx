description: My plan for the next decade
---

In 2014, after 4 years of studying, I decided to abandon my dream of becoming a teacher.

If you asked me at the time, I’d cite a few reason. Bad work life balance. Low pay. Poor job prospects.

But it really came down to one conversation.

As I was wrestling with all of the above, I went to visit my favourite high school teacher. I told her about my doubts, about my fears that teaching wouldn’t make me happy. She told me not to become a teacher.

Why? Because if I really cared about my students... if I really cared about their success, I would be miserable.

She said that great teachers spend so much time fighting the system (the bureaucracy, the cost cutting, the growing class sizes) that it becomes emotionally exhausting. 

Great teachers get burnt out. Great teachers quit.

She was, of course, an amazing teacher who stood as a counter-example to this. But given my existing doubts, I trusted her advice.

I didn’t become a teacher. Not then.

## Universities are broken

I had spent four years studying English literature. After turning away from teaching I was left with... few prospects.

I didn’t have any marketable skills. I didn’t know the first thing about finding a great career. I didn’t know how to market myself, or how to be a great worker.

Four years of university, and tens of thousands of dollars... and I had nothing?

What was I supposed to do?

Well, long story short, I went and got valuable skills. I attended a software bootcamp.

Eight weeks and ten grand later, I had a career. One that I still love and prosper in.

But clearly, something was wrong here.

How can an 8 week course give me more success than a four year degree? What is wrong with our educational model?

## The best teachers in the world

I still want to be a teacher. But I want to be one of the best.

And... I want to maximize my impact. I want to give my students much, much more than they pay for.

I want to change lives.

And... I want to be well paid for it.

All of these thoughts have been swirling in my thoughts for years, but only recently did they coalesce into a single thought.

I want to teach. And the best way I know how, in this day and age, is to teach online.

A simple plan: I want to make a million dollars teaching online.

And I want to do it by the time I’m forty. That gives me eleven and a half years.

For years, I've been searching for a mission; a central goal to organize my life around. I think I've found it.

## Millions and millions

There’s a perverse sentiment that you cannot both serve others and make a lot of money

As if greed poisons your intentions. It certainly can, if it becomes your focus. But that’s not for me.

Derek Sivers once said “money is a neutral indicator of value.”

If I want to be one of the best teachers in the world, I need to relentlessly focus on providing value for my students.

The easiest way to track that is with how many people are willing to pay me, and how much.

It’s also a great motivator.

I want to be paid according to my value. And I want to provide BIG impact.

A million millionaires

It’s not just about me.

All great teachers should be millionaires.

I want to enable them to be. I want to show them it’s possible, by doing it myself.

I don’t know if this is possible, of course... but I’d love to find out.

There's still much planning to be done. I don't plan on quitting my day job, for one. Not yet.

But this is the goal. This is my million dollar bet on myself.
