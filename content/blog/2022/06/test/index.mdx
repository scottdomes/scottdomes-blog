How do you talk to yourself when you screw up? Is your inner monologue kind, understanding, and patient? Or do you mock and berate yourself with vicious criticism?

Many of us default to the former. Worse, we often extend criticism of our actions ("you messed this up") to judgement of our character ("you messed this up because you're a failure"). Such harshness can often feel necessary, to "keep ourselves in line".

But if we externalize that monologue, we can see how counterproductive it is. Imagine speaking to a young child with the same tone as your self-talk. Here's Jay Earley contrasting that approach with a more compassionate stance, comparing what he calls the Inner Critic and the Inner Mentor:

> Suppose you are a parent and your child doesn't clean up his room the way you asked him to. If you act like an Inner Critic, you might say in a harsh, loud voice, “What a mess! You're so dumb. Can't you do anything right?” However, if you instead act like an Inner Mentor, you might say in a kind, supportive voice, “Honey, that's not quite what I was looking for. Let me show you how to clean up a room. Let's do it together.”

As Earley describes in his book _Self Therapy, Vol. 3_, the problem with the Inner Critic isn't the initial judgement. Often you do need to judge and correct your own behaviour. But the Inner Mentor "performs this necessary self-critical function in our psyches in a helpful way, whereas the Critic does it in a destructive way."

In Earley's example, we can recognize that calling the kid "dumb" isn't helpful. We know that calling an adult coworker dumb wouldn't make them better. But when it comes to ourselves, we change the rules.
