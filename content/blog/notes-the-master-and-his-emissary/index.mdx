Some neuroscientists posit that the primary purpose of corpus callosum, the "bridge" between the mind's two hemispheres, is to actually inhibit communcation between the two. It allows one hemisphere to override the other.

Metaphor is the foundation of education. To explain something, you must draw a parallel with some other, already understood concept.

Descartes saw the mind and body as two distinct "things". This division is classic left hemisphere, concerned with "what" the mind and body are. By contrast, the right hemisphere would see mind and body as two different "hows", two ways of interacting with the world.

Detachment allows us to stand back from our immediate experience, the raw visceral emotion of the moment. That detachment can be used to calculate and exploit, but it also allows us to be empathetic. We can detach from self-preoccupation and come to see others as people just like us. We can focus on their experience by detaching from our own.

Different people look at a mountain, and see different things: a landmark, a source of mineral wealth, a dwelling of gods, a subject to paint. What is the "real" mountain, to be distinguished from these perspectives? It doesn't exist. We can never separate the subject from the type of attention we are giving it.

The right hemisphere understands Heraclitus phrases: you can never step in the same river twice. Everything is in flow, nothing is truly predictable. Yet we need to learn from the world. So how do we get by? We need to step outside of the flow for a moment, to "fix" things in place, to analyze them. That's the left hemishpere's role: to "freeze" the world into some legible snapshot.

The right hemisphere is better at prediction when prediction is difficult. The left hemisphere excels at simple expectations, but is also limited by those expectations.

Relaxation promotes creativity. When we try to focus, we are narrowing our range of attention. Think of a spotlight. That's the left hemisphere. But relaxation broadens our attentional field, diffuses the light, and engages the right hemisphere. This broadening of attention allows us to make more associations between disparate concepts.

The "tip of the tongue" phenomenon, when we are trying to remember a word but can't... is an example of the above. The more we try, the more we narrow our attention, and the less able we are to find the word. Once we stop trying, it comes to us.

The left hemisphere deals with its own understanding of the world. As a result, it has more connections within itself than the right hemisphere.

Most neurons fatigue when continuously stimulated, which means they cease to respond. But one type does not. When we encounter new stimuli, it triggers the release of noradrenaline in the right hemisphere. The noradregenic neurons do not fatigue. We can hold exploratory attention for a long time. 

The right hemisphere also has a longer working memory than the left. It can hold more information for a longer time, with greater specificity.

The right hemisphere is dominant in most emotional expression... except anger. Anger comes from the left frontal lobe. Why? Anger is motivating, which means it is reward-seeking, and is thus tied to dopamine release.

We often separate ourselves from our body in everyday speech. There is "me" and then there is "my body". The ancient Greeks did not make this distinction. Their word for "the body as separate from the self", which was sõma (the root of our "somatic": pertaining to the body), was only ever used to refer to a corpse.

The right hemisphere helps us understand what others are thinking and feeling. Right hemisphere damage is thus correlated with having trouble understanding when someone is joking or lying. But left hemisphere damage makes people _better_ at detecting lies. In a healthy brain, our right hemisphere's inherent ability to detect lies is in fact hampered by our left hemisphere.

We rely on non-verbal communication (gesture, facial expression, intonation) to express complex and contradictory thoughts. A meaningful look can contain more complexity than a long speech. Why? Is our language not accurate enough? Just the opposite: our speech is too definite, too concrete. It struggles to express ambiguity and contradiction, which it's ill-suited for communicating our shifting emotional landscape.

Music is about the relationship between notes, and between the silence between notes. It is all about "betweenness". Each singular note is transformed by its context. Context and relationships are the concerns of the right hemisphere, and so music belongs to the right brain.

Walter Pater said that all art aspires towards the condition of music. In this context, we can say that all art "aspires to reside in the world that is delivered to us by the right hemisphere."

Music can help us feel both emotions we are familiar with, and emotions that we have never felt before. In this way, music transcends the limits of language. Language is inherently limited in describing feelings; music has a much greater power.

When we are learning something new, the right hemisphere dominates. Once that thing is familiar, the left hemisphere takes over. The music of J.S. Bach, which is often contrapuntal (composed of multiple independent melodic lines), has been shown to evoke right hemisphere activation even in experienced musicians.

The left hemisphere uses its existing knowledge of the world to create certainty. It "knows" what a thing is, isolated from its context. You know what a "car" is, as an abstraction, as a category. But the right hemisphere sees things as they actually are, not just as a category, so everything is constantly "new". You have seen a car before, but never this car in this exact context. The right hemisphere seeks the connotation, the left seeks the denotation.

How the left hemisphere convinces itself it is correct: in an experiment, researchers showed participants a random pattern of flashing lights, and had them try to predict the next light that would flash. The participants got it consistently wrong, as one might expect. However, at some point, the researchers switched the pattern so that the participants' predictions would always come true. After the experiment, the majority of participants declared that they had "figured out" the sequence, describing elaborate theories of the "real" pattern.

Right hemisphere damage is correlated with a certain "fearlessness": ignoring obstacles and dangers when pursuing a task, making a wholly insufficient effort, and then being surprised by failure. In short, that fearlessness is a product of failing to understand context.

Empathy belongs to the right hemisphere, but it is correlated with sadness. The more we feel for others, the more suffering we experience.

Aboulia (loss of will), akinesia (failure to move), and impersistence (inability to carry through an action) are correlated with right hemisphere damage.

A key part of this book's central thesis: we have two ways of experiencing the world. The first is being present and embodied, living in a world in constant flux, experiencing impermanence and change, feeling connected to a greater whole. The second is to "step outside the flow of experience" and fix the world at a moment in time, in a way that is more clear, legible, explicit and compartmentalized. We feel detached but also in control.

Science is concerned with a particular type of knowledge, the type that is fixed and permanent. In other words, results that can be reproduced and corroborated. But that knowledge must be detached from its context, and thus can only ever represent a small part of the whole.

Dogs use scent and body language as their primary means of communications amongst one another, but with humans they've learned that intonation matters most. They thus rely on a sort of musilanguage, both in "speaking" (whining, barking) and "listening" (the particular tone we take when we say "who's a good girl?"). Language likely evolved amongst humans from a similar sort of musilanguage, communicating via intonation.

Some breakthroughs are only possible when we step back from explicit awareness of the process. Many scientists stumbled upon their "eureka" moment only when they were not engaged in conscious thought. Einstein: "the words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in the mechanism of my thought…" In other words: focused awareness (left hemisphere) seems to inhibit creativity in some contexts.

The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis states that we are conceptually limited by our language: if we don't have a word for "blue", we won't perceive it. McGilchrist argues that this is only partially true. The concept of "blue" can arise without language, though there is a catch. Thought precedes language, but language is necessary to "fix" a concept in our minds, and thus return to it. Language creates consistency in how we think, which is both good (we can recall what blue is) and bad (we are restricted by the colours we know of).

Language also allows us to lie. It's difficult to lie with body language or gesture; often a micro-expression in our face gives us away. But with language we can craft a false version of reality. We can also communicate over long distances, and convince others to act for us. Language thus enables imperialism.

"Metaphor" comes from the Greek meta (across) and pherein (carry); something that carries you across a gap between the known and the unknown. "It's like..."

Language is built on metaphor. Everything ties back to our embodied existance. Even abstract concepts (like the word 'virtual'), if you trace their etymology, come back to something physical (the Latin word for strength, virtus). It's a long, winding chain of metaphors to get from virtus to virtual, but the chain exists. "Everything has to be expressed in terms of something else." We could not construct language without starting from the world around us.
