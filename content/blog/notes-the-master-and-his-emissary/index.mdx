Some neuroscientists posit that the primary purpose of corpus callosum, the "bridge" between the mind's two hemispheres, is to actually inhibit communcation between the two. It allows one hemisphere to override the other.

Metaphor is the foundation of education. To explain something, you must draw a parallel with some other, already understood concept.

Descartes saw the mind and body as two distinct "things". This division is classic left hemisphere, concerned with "what" the mind and body are. By contrast, the right hemisphere would see mind and body as two different "hows", two ways of interacting with the world.

Detachment allows us to stand back from our immediate experience, the raw visceral emotion of the moment. That detachment can be used to calculate and exploit, but it also allows us to be empathetic. We can detach from self-preoccupation and come to see others as people just like us. We can focus on their experience by detaching from our own.

Different people look at a mountain, and see different things: a landmark, a source of mineral wealth, a dwelling of gods, a subject to paint. What is the "real" mountain, to be distinguished from these perspectives? It doesn't exist. We can never separate the subject from the type of attention we are giving it.

The right hemisphere understands Heraclitus phrases: you can never step in the same river twice. Everything is in flow, nothing is truly predictable. Yet we need to learn from the world. So how do we get by? We need to step outside of the flow for a moment, to "fix" things in place, to analyze them. That's the left hemishpere's role: to "freeze" the world into some legible snapshot.

The right hemisphere is better at prediction when prediction is difficult. The left hemisphere excels at simple expectations, but is also limited by those expectations.

Relaxation promotes creativity. When we try to focus, we are narrowing our range of attention. Think of a spotlight. That's the left hemisphere. But relaxation broadens our attentional field, diffuses the light, and engages the right hemisphere. This broadening of attention allows us to make more associations between disparate concepts.

The "tip of the tongue" phenomenon, when we are trying to remember a word but can't... is an example of the above. The more we try, the more we narrow our attention, and the less able we are to find the word. Once we stop trying, it comes to us.

The left hemisphere deals with its own understanding of the world. As a result, it has more connections within itself than the right hemisphere.

Most neurons fatigue when continuously stimulated, which means they cease to respond. But one type does not. When we encounter new stimuli, it triggers the release of noradrenaline in the right hemisphere. The noradregenic neurons do not fatigue. We can hold exploratory attention for a long time. 

The right hemisphere also has a longer working memory than the left. It can hold more information for a longer time, with greater specificity.

The right hemisphere is dominant in most emotional expression... except anger. Anger comes from the left frontal lobe. Why? Anger is motivating, which means it is reward-seeking, and is thus tied to dopamine release.

The universe itself exhibits profound asymmetry. Life itself is a function of that asymmetry, a result of asymmetric distribution of elements.

The evolution of frontal lobes is the double-edged sword that allowed us to both exploit the world and be its guardian, to be both highly destructive and highly social.
