Some neuroscientists posit that the primary purpose of corpus callosum, the "bridge" between the mind's two hemispheres, is to actually inhibit communcation between the two. It allows one hemisphere to override the other.

Metaphor is the foundation of education. To explain something, you must draw a parallel with some other, already understood concept.

Descartes saw the mind and body as two distinct "things". This division is classic left hemisphere, concerned with "what" the mind and body are. By contrast, the right hemisphere would see mind and body as two different "hows", two ways of interacting with the world.

Detachment allows us to stand back from our immediate experience, the raw visceral emotion of the moment. That detachment can be used to calculate and exploit, but it also allows us to be empathetic. We can detach from self-preoccupation and come to see others as people just like us. We can focus on their experience by detaching from our own.

Different people look at a mountain, and see different things: a landmark, a source of mineral wealth, a dwelling of gods, a subject to paint. What is the "real" mountain, to be distinguished from these perspectives? It doesn't exist. We can never separate the subject from the type of attention we are giving it.

The right hemisphere understands Heraclitus phrases: you can never step in the same river twice. Everything is in flow, nothing is truly predictable. Yet we need to learn from the world. So how do we get by? We need to step outside of the flow for a moment, to "fix" things in place, to analyze them. That's the left hemishpere's role: to "freeze" the world into some legible snapshot.

The right hemisphere is better at prediction when prediction is difficult. The left hemisphere excels at simple expectations, but is also limited by those expectations.

Relaxation promotes creativity. When we try to focus, we are narrowing our range of attention. Think of a spotlight. That's the left hemisphere. But relaxation broadens our attentional field, diffuses the light, and engages the right hemisphere. This broadening of attention allows us to make more associations between disparate concepts.

The "tip of the tongue" phenomenon, when we are trying to remember a word but can't... is an example of the above. The more we try, the more we narrow our attention, and the less able we are to find the word. Once we stop trying, it comes to us.

The left hemisphere deals with its own understanding of the world. As a result, it has more connections within itself than the right hemisphere.

Most neurons fatigue when continuously stimulated, which means they cease to respond. But one type does not. When we encounter new stimuli, it triggers the release of noradrenaline in the right hemisphere. The noradregenic neurons do not fatigue. We can hold exploratory attention for a long time. 

The right hemisphere also has a longer working memory than the left. It can hold more information for a longer time, with greater specificity.

The right hemisphere is dominant in most emotional expression... except anger. Anger comes from the left frontal lobe. Why? Anger is motivating, which means it is reward-seeking, and is thus tied to dopamine release.

We often separate ourselves from our body in everyday speech. There is "me" and then there is "my body". The ancient Greeks did not make this distinction. Their word for "the body as separate from the self", which was sõma (the root of our "somatic": pertaining to the body), was only ever used to refer to a corpse.

The right hemisphere helps us understand what others are thinking and feeling. Right hemisphere damage is thus correlated with having trouble understanding when someone is joking or lying. But left hemisphere damage makes people _better_ at detecting lies. In a healthy brain, our right hemisphere's inherent ability to detect lies is in fact hampered by our left hemisphere.

We rely on non-verbal communication (gesture, facial expression, intonation) to express complex and contradictory thoughts. A meaningful look can contain more complexity than a long speech. Why? Is our language not accurate enough? Just the opposite: our speech is too definite, too concrete. It struggles to express ambiguity and contradiction, which it's ill-suited for communicating our shifting emotional landscape.

Music is about the relationship between notes, and between the silence between notes. It is all about "betweenness". Each singular note is transformed by its context. Context and relationships are the concerns of the right hemisphere, and so music belongs to the right brain.

Walter Pater said that all art aspires towards the condition of music. In this context, we can say that all art "aspires to reside in the world that is delivered to us by the right hemisphere."

Music can help us feel both emotions we are familiar with, and emotions that we have never felt before. In this way, music transcends the limits of language. Language is inherently limited in describing feelings; music has a much greater power.

When we are learning something new, the right hemisphere dominates. Once that thing is familiar, the left hemisphere takes over. The music of J.S. Bach, which is often contrapuntal (composed of multiple independent melodic lines), has been shown to evoke right hemisphere activation even in experienced musicians.

The left hemisphere uses its existing knowledge of the world to create certainty. It "knows" what a thing is, isolated from its context. You know what a "car" is, as an abstraction, as a category. But the right hemisphere sees things as they actually are, not just as a category, so everything is constantly "new". You have seen a car before, but never this car in this exact context. The right hemisphere seeks the connotation, the left seeks the denotation.

How the left hemisphere convinces itself it is correct: in an experiment, researchers showed participants a random pattern of flashing lights, and had them try to predict the next light that would flash. The participants got it consistently wrong, as one might expect. However, at some point, the researchers switched the pattern so that the participants' predictions would always come true. After the experiment, the majority of participants declared that they had "figured out" the sequence, describing elaborate theories of the "real" pattern.

Right hemisphere damage is correlated with a certain "fearlessness": ignoring obstacles and dangers when pursuing a task, making a wholly insufficient effort, and then being surprised by failure. In short, that fearlessness is a product of failing to understand context.

Empathy belongs to the right hemisphere, but it is correlated with sadness. The more we feel for others, the more suffering we experience.

Aboulia (loss of will), akinesia (failure to move), and impersistence (inability to carry through an action) are correlated with right hemisphere damage.

A key part of this book's central thesis: we have two ways of experiencing the world. The first is being present and embodied, living in a world in constant flux, experiencing impermanence and change, feeling connected to a greater whole. The second is to "step outside the flow of experience" and fix the world at a moment in time, in a way that is more clear, legible, explicit and compartmentalized. We feel detached but also in control.

Science is concerned with a particular type of knowledge, the type that is fixed and permanent. In other words, results that can be reproduced and corroborated. But that knowledge must be detached from its context, and thus can only ever represent a small part of the whole.

Dogs use scent and body language as their primary means of communications amongst one another, but with humans they've learned that intonation matters most. They thus rely on a sort of musilanguage, both in "speaking" (whining, barking) and "listening" (the particular tone we take when we say "who's a good girl?"). Language likely evolved amongst humans from a similar sort of musilanguage, communicating via intonation.

Some breakthroughs are only possible when we step back from explicit awareness of the process. Many scientists stumbled upon their "eureka" moment only when they were not engaged in conscious thought. Einstein: "the words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in the mechanism of my thought…" In other words: focused awareness (left hemisphere) seems to inhibit creativity in some contexts.

The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis states that we are conceptually limited by our language: if we don't have a word for "blue", we won't perceive it. McGilchrist argues that this is only partially true. The concept of "blue" can arise without language, though there is a catch. Thought precedes language, but language is necessary to "fix" a concept in our minds, and thus return to it. Language creates consistency in how we think, which is both good (we can recall what blue is) and bad (we are restricted by the colours we know of).

Language also allows us to lie. It's difficult to lie with body language or gesture; often a micro-expression in our face gives us away. But with language we can craft a false version of reality. We can also communicate over long distances, and convince others to act for us. Language thus enables imperialism.

"Metaphor" comes from the Greek meta (across) and pherein (carry); something that carries you across a gap between the known and the unknown. "It's like..."

Language is built on metaphor. Everything ties back to our embodied existance. Even abstract concepts (like the word 'virtual'), if you trace their etymology, come back to something physical (the Latin word for strength, virtus). It's a long, winding chain of metaphors to get from virtus to virtual, but the chain exists. "Everything has to be expressed in terms of something else." We could not construct language without starting from the world around us.

The best way to learn a skill is to observe an expert. Many experts are unable to formulate exactly what they are doing; the skill has become intuitive. Rule-following might bootstrap the learning process, but eventually one must pursue embodiment.

Language was derived from music, from that musilanguage of intonation. Music and language are emotionally compelling for individuals in a group; they bind us together. It allows harmonization of emotional states, for you to not only understand what I'm feeling but also feel it yourself.

When multiple humans are singing, their instinct is to synchronise rhythm and blend pitch. This is unique to humans. Birds, when they sing, are trying to attract a mate; their singing is individualistic and competitive. Bird singing is controlled by their left hemisphere, whereas ours originates in the right.

The universe consists of forces that tend towards coherence/unification, and forces that tend towards incoherence/separation. The world emerges out of that tension. In turn, the hemispheres of our brain reflect the same push-pull.

"Attention is a moral act." Focused attention is about choosing what is worthy and what is not. Do you pay attention to the beauty of the forest, or the monetary value of its lumber?

Before Plato, philosophy was more of a right-hemisphere process (see Heraclitus). It did not lean on abstraction and decontextualization. After Plato, we got over two millenia of analytical philosophy, dividing the world into chunks of logic that proceeded sequentially. Only in the 19th century did this begin to change, with philosophers like Nietzsche tearing at the foundation of that abstract edifice.

To manipulate something you have to separate it from its context and fix it in space and time. You must divide the world to manipulate it, and the left hemisphere's governing principle is division.

A paradox: if you take a heap of sand, and remove one grain at a time, at what point does it cease to be a "heap"? Paradoxes are an indication our left hemisphere's model of the world is insufficient: here, the fixed concept of "heap" doesn't work with something that is in the process of change. To "solve" the paradox, we either need to draw an arbitary definition ("a heap is 2000 grains of sand") or throw out the concept ("nothing is really a heap"). Either way, the left hemisphere tries to force the world to fit into its boxes.

The left hemisphere views knowledge like a wall, constructed one brick at a time. Each "brick" must be evaluated on its own, separated from its context, and thus we slowly proceed to absolute truth.

The philosopher Husserl believed in an objective reality, but said that it was created through shared experience (intersubjectivity). By being around other emboedied individuals, and having access to their experience via empathy, we construct our mutual reality.

The left hemisphere builds the picture, pixel by pixel; for the right hemisphere, it comes into focus all at once.

Heidegger believed understanding came from "unconcealing" parts of the world, which can only be achieved through patient attention. See the Greek concept of aletheia (related to the word lethe, meaning forgetfulness and concealment, as in the river in Greek mythology). Aletheia was a Greek goddess, known as Veritas to the Romans. But Heidegger did not see unconcealing/aletheia as truth, but as intelligibility; as part of a background of meaning. Aletheia was thus a glimpse of the greater context.

Truth-as-unconcealing is different our idea of truth-as-correctness. The former is progress towards something that is never fully in sight; the latter is fixed, full knowledge.

Heidegger didn't see humanity as the center of the world. Rather, we are privileged listeners. We ought to try to listen to and care for the world.

The left hemisphere, Cartesian view of the body is that we are the pilot of a piece of machinery: we "drive" the body around. The right hemisphere views it as a lived experience.

Heidegger saw language as something that "speaks in us". The left hemisphere sees language as a tool, something it uses to communicate its fixed knowledge. But what if we allow language to arise from the right hemisphere, to see what emerges, to see what we become connected to?

Understanding comes from allowing something to awaken within us. We don't grasp at it; we allow it to emerge.

The Hebrew meaning of good and evil, as in the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, means the useful and useless. By eating the fruit, Adam and Eve learned precise knowledge of what is useful for survival.

The television serves the same purpose that the fire in the hearth used to: as a shared focal point during a social gathering. We can spend time together, without having to focus too much on each other. We sit side-by-side, instead of facing each other.

The right hemisphere longs to connect and care for the world. The left hemisphere longs to control it.

Archetypes emerge from the right hemisphere. They are not rigid types that can be reduced to a set of rules. Rather, they describe an aspirational experience.

The left hemisphere aspires to control, but some things cannot be manipulated. You can't force falling asleep, and "trying" only makes it more difficult. Other examples McGilchrist highlights: making love, trying to be natural, trying to be wise or innnocent. Parts of our experience are beyond our control; we can only allow these parts to arise.

Nietzsche: "thoughts are the shadows of our feelings-always darker, emptier, simpler."

So feelings come before thoughts, which means emotion is not just a distraction or extension of cognition. Cognition follows our emotions and our bodily experience.

The frontal cortex, the most evolved part of the brain, functions via selection. We perceive a stimulus, and responses arise; the frontal cortex chooses one by negating the others. It is never the origin; it is the filter.

Nietzsche's distinction between the Greek gods Apollo and Dionysos does not map perfectly to left/right hemisphere, but there are some correlations. Apollo associates with order, rationality, perfection, control of nature, and "the celebration of masks, representations, and appearances." Dionysos represents intuition, trangressing boundaries, pleasure and pain, and celebration of nature. 

Returning to the frontal cortex: it can only say "no" or "not no" to what arises elsewhere. William Blake, in the The Marraige of Heaven and Hell: "Energy is the only life, and is from the Body; and Reason is the bound or outward circumference of Energy."

Many spiritual practices focus on the "annhilation" of self as a primary goal. McGilchrist argues that this is a mistranslation of sorts. The goal isn't to get rid of yourself, but to eliminate the boundaries between you and the rest of the universe. What are you without those boundaries? Well, you are everything.

The word invention comes from the Latin invenire, which means to find. It is discovery, rather than creation; or, once again, unconcealing.

The landscape does not create the river, though it both changes it and is changed by it. The landscape, at points, either says 'no' or 'not-no' to the river, and thus the river's course is revealed. The river comes into being as a result of that encuounter. We discover ourselves through our interaction with the world; where the world says no or not-no, where we say no or not-no.

The Greeks strove to be more Apollonian that Dionysian, to seek perfection and control, to become the masters of their world. But we have become far too Apollonian; we are already masters, but we continue to view our world as just a resource to be exploited.

The Baldwin effect is something that accelerates the evolution of certain traits, as a result of interaction with the environment. If being articulate leads to success in your life, you're likely to select an articulate mate, and thus the genes associated with that quality persist.

Humans have a tremendous ability to imitate. Only humans and birds can imitate sounds, but only humans can imitate a series of actions. If we see someone accomplishing a certain goal, we can mimic their means. This mimesis is a result of being able to feel their experience; empathy.

Trackers in hunting culture strive to "become" the animal they're tracking, feeling what it's feeling. Immersion via empathy.

Once humans evolved a refined ability to imitate, our abilities must have rapidly increased. Skill transmission would have accelerated exponentially. Perhaps this correlates with the rapid expansion of the brain in early hominids.

McGilchrist theorizes that around the 4th century in ancient Greece, right hemisphere functioning quickly advanced. This shift is represented in art, as facial expressions became much more varied and empathetic.

The bicameral mind theory states that early humans experienced the hemispheres as wholly separate, and so they believed that their thoughts and feelings were "the voice of the gods." Consciousness, or the ability to introspect, came from greater communication between hemispheres; I could recognize my thoughts and feelings as "mine" and thus reflect on them.
But McGilchrist thinks this is backwards: the hemispheres started out more unified, and gradually separated. Before that division, there was no difference between impulse and action; there was no distance from me and my thoughts and feelings. But after separation,the right hemisphere's intuitions could now be considered by the left hemisphere's cognition. Now there could be some detachment between "me" and my impulses and feelings, and thus introspection becomes possible.
The crux of the debate: does the ability to introspect come from identifying with intuition, or from detachment from intuition?

Another way of putting it: Jayne sees the experience of "the voice of the gods" as a result of opening a door between hemispheres, whereas McGilchrist sees it as the closing of the door. The voices of intuition either are suddenly present and thus disorienting, or suddenly distant and thus uncanny.

The Greek playwright Aeschylus was a Dionysian in the Nietzschean sense, focusing on the intuitive and imaginative in his art. Sophocles: "Aeschylus does what is right without knowing it."
