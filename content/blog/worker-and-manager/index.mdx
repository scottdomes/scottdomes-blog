description: Seeking a kinder relationship with our selves

I've struggled a lot in my creative practice. The main problem has been expecting too much of myself. 

Maybe you know the feeling: the late night surge of energy, where we plan the perfect creative routine for the next week. The ambitious vision of finding an extra hour in my day to do some writing. The expectations of unlimited energy, even after a full day of work.

Cut to me, one week later, overwhelmed and miserable, and angry at myself for being miserable.

The problem is that there are two parts involved in this process: the part of me that sets goals, and the part of me who has to fulfill them.

The goal-setter is ambitious. He's free to dream big, and promise the world. He deals with the abstract future, where anything is possible.

The goal-achiever is the one who has to find the time, to carve out hours in the middle of busy days. He has to work through fatigue and stress, and push himself to the limits.

That relationship, between goal-setter and goal-achiever, can easily become toxic. It can be like any bad manager-employee relationship: nothing gets done, and everyone is unhappy.

If I routinely fail to meet my goals, it's easy to criticize the worker me. But maybe that's not the issue. Maybe manager me has unrealistic expectations. How do I know?

First, I can take a step back from criticism. Harsh criticism is never motivating, nor useful. Instead, I can try to understand __why__ worker-me failed. 

A better question: how can I create the conditions for success? How can I make success feel good? How can I make it easy?

That's what the best managers do. They create a motivating environment, through a combination of praise, positive reinforcement, and rewards. That's our job when working with ourselves.

Here's a journal prompt to consider: in your creative process, what's one goal you've set in the past that was "too much"? What would a more realistic version of that goal look like?
