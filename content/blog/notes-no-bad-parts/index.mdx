Our current cultural paradigm believes humanity is inherently flawed, and that we are fundamentally disconnected from each other. We need to instead embrace a frame that believes in our inherent goodness and interconnection.

IFS is about relating to your internal parts and to people in your life in a loving way, on a daily, moment-to-moment basis.

John Calvin: "For our nature is not only utterly devoid of goodness, but so prolific in all kinds of evil, that it can never be idle â€¦ The whole man, from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot, is so deluged, as it were, that no part remains exempt from sin, and, therefore, everything which proceeds from him is imputed as sin." This "doctrine of total depravity" became a highly influential Christian theory.

If we choose to dominate our unwanted parts, through punishment and coercion, we might succeed. But we must be rigid and controlling at all times; any trigger or moment of weakness will cause those parts to overwhelm us. Think of someone who seeks to have a "perfect" diet, but devolves into out-of-control binging whenever junk food is around.

Trying to shame yourself into "proper" behaviour is about as successful as trying to shame your child into doing the right thing. Sometimes it may work, but not without damage, and not without consequences.

Some of our parts may want things that aren't good for them or aren't good for the system as a whole. Just as we might deal with an impulsive child, we need to be firm, patient, and loving in saying no.

Parts are not cognitive adaptations or malevolent impulses. Rather, they are sacred, spiritual beings, and we must treat them as such.

Parts will describe themselves as having bodies, which in turn contain the emotions and beliefs they were forced to carry. They may have "a huge weight on their shoulders", or be covered in mud, which are what we call burdens.
