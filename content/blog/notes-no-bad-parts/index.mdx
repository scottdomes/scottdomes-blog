Our current cultural paradigm believes humanity is inherently flawed, and that we are fundamentally disconnected from each other. We need to instead embrace a frame that believes in our inherent goodness and interconnection.

IFS is about relating to your internal parts and to people in your life in a loving way, on a daily, moment-to-moment basis.

John Calvin: "For our nature is not only utterly devoid of goodness, but so prolific in all kinds of evil, that it can never be idle … The whole man, from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot, is so deluged, as it were, that no part remains exempt from sin, and, therefore, everything which proceeds from him is imputed as sin." This "doctrine of total depravity" became a highly influential Christian theory.

If we choose to dominate our unwanted parts, through punishment and coercion, we might succeed. But we must be rigid and controlling at all times; any trigger or moment of weakness will cause those parts to overwhelm us. Think of someone who seeks to have a "perfect" diet, but devolves into out-of-control binging whenever junk food is around.

Trying to shame yourself into "proper" behaviour is about as successful as trying to shame your child into doing the right thing. Sometimes it may work, but not without damage, and not without consequences.

Some of our parts may want things that aren't good for them or aren't good for the system as a whole. Just as we might deal with an impulsive child, we need to be firm, patient, and loving in saying no.

Parts are not cognitive adaptations or malevolent impulses. Rather, they are sacred, spiritual beings, and we must treat them as such.

Parts will describe themselves as having bodies, which in turn contain the emotions and beliefs they were forced to carry. They may have "a huge weight on their shoulders", or be covered in mud, which are what we call burdens.

Some burdens are inherited, either from your parents or the culture you live in. These we can call "legacy burdens".

People who suffer abuse as children can sometimes take on the violent energy of their abuser and integrate it as a protective mechanism. This transference is why victims of abuse become perpetrators. Part of them is frozen in that rage and inflicts it upon others in order to feel safe.

The goal: when triggered, to be able to quickly notice what parts are being activated and ask them to step back you. This process becomes easier the more your parts come to trust you.

Infant researcher T. Berry Brazelton found that infants have around five or six states, which is evidence that parts are innate.

By healing your relationship with your parts, they can become friends, advisors, and playmates. Spending your life with them becomes a nourishing experience for all.

Parts work parallels the life of Jesus: going out to the exiles, the lepers, the poor, the outcasts, and greeting them with love, and working to heal them.

Self leadership resembles couple's counselling: you listen to each part in turn, and get them each to trust you, and then faciliate a discussion between them.

When going through parts work, unusual physical symptoms may arise: sleepiness, headaches, distraction. These are protectors stepping in because they feel you aren't quite ready. As always, the path forward is not to fight them, but to greet them with curiousity and understanding.

Systems thinking: studying cells individually does not help you understand how they form a living organisms. You cannot fully separate the part from the context of the greater system; it must be understood within the system.

Systems thinking also applies to family dynamics: if you treat the symptoms of the child without addressing the family structure, any improvements will be fragile and temporary.

We make the same mistake at a cultural level: politics are all about arguing about symptoms rather than addressing the core beliefs that drive those problems.

A few of the core beliefs of our culture, which largely remain unquestioned:
- economic growth is good
- nature is a resource to be exploited
- we are the pinnacle of evolution, which has now stopped
- one can own land
Other cultures would've questioned or outright rejected these premises.

The nocebo effect means that if you believe a sugar pill will make you sick, it probably will. Our negative beliefs about other people can have a real effect on their performance.

Taking a combative approach to healing (destroying, controlling, or monitoring your "bad" parts) comes from the belief that you are fundamentally dangerous and not to be trusted. That belief will extend to how you approach societal problems: should people be controlled and coerced, or not?

Worth quoting in full:
>Then our teachers have their say: “Good children don't get angry over such little things.” So we take our anger and put it in the bag. By the time my brother and I were twelve in Madison, Minnesota, we were known as “the nice Bly boys.” Our bags were already a mile long…. When we put a part of ourselves in the bag it regresses. It de-evolves toward barbarism. Suppose a young man seals a bag at twenty and then waits fifteen or twenty years before he opens it again. What will he find? Sadly, the sexuality, the wildness, the impulsiveness, the anger, the freedom he put in have all regressed; they are not only primitive in mood, they are hostile to the person who opens the bag.

An unloved child will eventually become angry with us. An unloved part will eventually become hostile to us.

Exiled parts feel vulnerable, and so your subconscious enlists other parts to become protectors. Protectors try to prevent harm to exiles by "controlling" your experience; the quickest way to do that is to become hypercritical of your behaviour, and repeatedly yell at you to do the "safe" things. Thus we end up with a bunch of inner critics, and bunch of parts in roles they don't wants.

Firefighters will do anything to escape feelings they perceive as dangerous. They can even go so far as suicide.

Firefighters will also desperately seek sources of solace. Often, that means seeking certain "special" people, moving from one to the next in terms of safe refuge.

It's useful to learn how certain parts react to engagement. For example, if you spend one day listening to an exile's pain, and then the next day you have the urge to get drunk, understanding that sequence will allow you to better detach and assess. Managers want to repress firefighters and exiles, and only through patient understanding of our impulses can we avoid colluding with them in that process.

To engage with exiles, you need permission from protectors. Protectors have spent years or decades keeping everyone away, and they won't let you in without good reason to trust you.

Trying to skip past protectors and dealing with exiles in intense pain can often lead to backlash: suicidal ideation, physical pain, depressive episodes, distrust of the therapist. The term the author uses here is being "ecologically sensitive guests in our clients' ecosystem."

Parts can become angry with each other or with themselves if they feel unable to get the love they need. They blame it on their own mistakes.

Our "default" state is barely noticing our parts, because they work in perfect harmony. This is how we would function if our environment was also perfectly harmonious, including our culture, our family, and our peer group.

Working with exiles is a process of unburdening them: allowing them the space needed to learn to trust you, then bearing witness to their traumatic experiences, and then allowing them to unload their difficult beliefs and emotions.

We know we're in Self when we embody some or all of the "Eight C's":
- curiousity
- calm
- confidence
- compassion
- creativity
- clarity
- courage
- connectedness

Compassion is the ability to be with someone who is really in pain, and feel empathy for them without being overwhelmed. We can practice this process with our own parts. We learn to sit with exiles without blending with them.

When you're embodying the Eight C's, what are some markers? Your voice might be lively rather than monotone, your body language might be open rather than closed, and you probably will find it easier to find compassion for whoever you're interacting with. Knowing these markers, you can assume that when they're not present, some part has become active. Then, identify that part, separate from them, and remind them that they can trust you.

Even patients without good parenting role models are able to spontaneously begin relating to their parts in a loving way. In other words: the Self is always able and ready to begin to lead.

Becoming a good caretaker of your parts means your loved ones don't have to be their primary caretaker instead. They can assist, of course, but becoming your own inner leader relieves some of the pressure on your support circle.

Positive transference is when our parts identify someone else as their "saviour": the ideal protector, redeemer, or lover. Thus we develop unrealistic expectations for that person, and are inevitably disappointed.

Donald Trump is a good example of how knowledge of parts can fuel compassion. Trump obviously is suffering, with parts stuck in childhood and adolescence. We can be upset about the damage those parts are doing to the world while also feeling empathy for the man who is unable to give his parts the love they need.

When doing a parts visualization, watch out for when you begin to take a "third-person" perspective: watching yourself comfort another part. That's a sign that a third part has joined in and is trying to help. Just politely ask them to let you handle this.

Along with the Eight C's, there's also the Five P's: patience, persistence, presence, perspective, and playfulness.

Parts work can even be effective in life threatening situation. Schwartz describes a time he was close to drowning, and was able to reassure his parts (and thus calm his panic) by saying that he'd be with them even in dying.

Protector parts will often resort to hedonism, egotism, or dissociation to keep our exiles safe. Removing those defense mechanisms will allow us to shift our priorities, and have more clarity about our vision for life. Even altruistic instincts can be driven by hurt parts (i.e. needing to appear virtuous), and can warp our approach to living.

Protectors take over our attention to keep exiles safe. By necessity, they drown out the more sensitive and loving parts (which are the ones more likely to be hurt). Thus, unburdening exiles is a process of rediscovering the parts of you that want to love, create, and be intimate.

Healing in IFS = wholeness and reconnection.

Healing is a connective process; restoring connection between estranged parts. But integration also fosters simplicity and clarity, all parts working together towards thriving.

When we try to articulate and pursue a vision of our life, it's easy for our managers to step in and hijack the process. But if we focus on helping our protectors relax, a vision can spontaneously emerge, as something received rather than created.

Schwartz sees Maslow as tending too much towards striving to "be all you can be." Instead, focus on relaxing the parts who are preoccupied with survival.

But at the same time, parts will often object to a Self-led vision, as being too grand, too ambitious, not realistic enough. Signs of objection: "who do you think you are/that will never work/you can't make a living doing that!"

Schwartz struggled with the above process: when he started devoting himself to IFS, he had to work with his parts and hear their objections at every step. Even now, writing this book, those voices are still present. It's always an ongoing process. However, he focuses on keeping them present, and teaching them to trust him. This trust allows them to soften and be less harsh and loud, and to know that no matter what, he'll be okay.

Being Self-led allows *presence* because your parts aren't stuck in some past hurt, or worried about properly being protected in the future. You can relax into whatever activity you're doing, and really experience it.

Some parts may object to your vision as being too small. A lovely quote from Charles Eisenstein: "So many people squelch the expression of their gifts by thinking that they must do something big with them. One's own actions are not enough--one must write a book that reaches millions. How quickly this turns into a competition over whose ideas get heard. How it invalidates the small, beautiful strivings of the bulk of humanity--invalidates, paradoxically, the very things we must start doing en masse to sustain a livable planet."

The "constraint releasing" approach to Self-access: notice what parts get in the way of accessing your Self, and then get to know them, and help them trust you in that situation. Don't try to force Self qualities.

The Self is able to maintain a balance between separation and unity. Schwartz uses the term immanence to describe the sense of being fully human, and contrasts it with transcendence: knowing that we belong to a greater whole. We want both the empathy and presence that comes from immanence and the wisdom and perspective that comes from transcendence.

True caring is about serving another person's highest needs: helping them grow to become healthier, freer, wiser, and more autonmous. It also has a multiplicative effect: by serving them in this way, we make them better able and willing to care for others.

What Csikszentmihalyi called flow is similar to what the Buddhists call anatta, or no-self. It is a feeling of being absorbed in the moment, without a sense of separation.

A quote from the novel The Color Purple: “But one day when I was sitting quiet and feeling like a motherless child, which I was, it came to me: that feeling of being part of everything, not separate at all. I knew that if I cut a tree my arm would bleed. And I laughed and I cried and I run all around the house. I just knew what it was. In fact, when it happen, you can't miss it.”

Being in Self means being aware that I am separate for others (people, trees, rivers) only in the way two waves of the sea appear separate. True separation is a myth.

While in Self we also feel a vibrating energy, and feel joy as a natural condition of being.

Diebels and Leary created a "Belief in Oneness Scale":
1. Beyond surface appearances, everything is fundamentally one.
2. Although many seemingly separate things exist, they all are part of the same whole. 
3. At the most basic level of reality, everything is one. 
4. The separation among individual things is an illusion; in reality everything is one. 
5. Everything is composed of the same basic substance, whether one thinks of it as spirit, consciousness, quantum processes, or whatever. 
6. The same basic essence permeates everything that exist.

Our true nature, our Self, is not something that is found after great striving. It is when we simply stop trying to be somebody else.

If we fear we're worthless, we'll chase achievement in order to counter that suspicion. But that achievement will feel false, like we're fooling people, and we'll have to hide our true selves in order to keep up the act. By embracing our own worthiness, we can release the need for positive feedback and external validation.

A deep, permanent sense of our own worth gives us the courage to present our Selves and our idea to an often skeptical and critical world.

Situations that cause us pain and torment are teaching us about what we need to heal. They thus become a valuable part of our own growth. That doesn't mean bad things happen to us _because_ of our own behaviour (sometimes bad stuff just happens), but if we feel able, we can use it as an opportunity to care for our parts and earn their trust.

AFGO (Another Fucking Growth Opportunity) is a way of looking at life as a series of opportunities to discover ourselves.

Our parts overwhelm us when they think we will ignore them or try to lock them away unless they take full control. Simply asking them not to overwhelm is often enough.
